On my personnal server, I used to send myself alerts by email using the handy standard [`mail`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mail) command.
However, recently it appeared that my server became categorized as "spammer" by some online service providers,
due to the alerts frequency (a little bit more than one per day).

Hence, I got rid of the postfix package and cumbersome configuration and decided to find an alternative solution.
I hesitated between [Sentry](https://sentry.io), a big player in the alerting-as-a-service domain that has the big advantage to be open source
(and developped in Python !), and [rollbar](https://rollbar.com), for which I opted for because of its simplicty (and by curiosity).

Then, I only had to `pip install rollbar` on my server and create a `/usr/local/bin/mail` executable file with the following code:
```
#!/usr/bin/python
import rollbar, socket, sys
rollbar.init('rollbar token')
rollbar.report_message(socket.gethostname() + ' sent an email:' + ' '.join(sys.argv[1:]),
                       extra_data={'stdin': sys.stdin.read()})
```

Et voilÃ  !

All my pre-existing scripts now send alerts to the rollbar web API,
I still receive email notifications from this service
**and** I now have an online web dashboard and extra functionnalities like alerts aggregation ðŸŽ‰

**EDIT [2022/05/03]**: in case of [rate-limit exceeded](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/rate-limits), the `pyrollbar` Python client will raise a warning, not an error:
[`rollbar/__init__.py` line 1700](https://github.com/rollbar/pyrollbar/blob/master/rollbar/__init__.py#L1700) ðŸ˜”

```
WARNING:rollbar:Rollbar: over rate limit, data was dropped. Payload was:...
```

There is how to transform this warning into a proper `mail` command failure, because [fail-fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast) is **The Way**:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import logging, rollbar, sys
from logging.handlers import BufferingHandler

log_handler = BufferingHandler(capacity=100)
rollbar.log.addHandler(log_handler)

rollbar.init('rollbar token', handler='blocking')
rollbar.report_message(socket.gethostname() + ' sent an email:' + ' '.join(sys.argv[1:]),
                   extra_data={'stdin': sys.stdin.read()})

if any('data was dropped' in record.message for record in log_handler.buffer):
    sys.exit(1)
```
