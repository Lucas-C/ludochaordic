Last month, I realized late that October was [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) month!

This online event is a month-long celebration (October 1-31) of open source software run in partnership with different software companies, with a focus on encouraging contributions to open source projects.

While I participated in the 2019 edition as a contributor, with [@kleph](https://github.com/kleph) & [@minitux](https://github.com/minitux),
this year I wanted to involve myself as a maintainer around the [fpdf2](https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/) Python project,
a minimalist PDF creation library.

In this blog post I simply want to share my personal experience with this event.


## Set up
The first tier of October had already passed when I realized hacktoberfest had started,
so I quickly took a few actions to ensure the `fpdf2` project was ready to receive contributions from newcomers:

* I skimmed through the event rules, and ensured the repo had the `hacktoberfest` tag
* I enabled [discussions](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/discussions) on the GitHub project,
  in hope it would allow for more casual chats with contributors (not a massive success)
* I tagged some `fpdf2` [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues) with the `hacktoberfest` label,
  to make it easy for curious developers to spot issues they could contribute to.
  I also tried to redact those issues in a way that would make them accessible and interesting to work on.
* I created 3 extra `good first issues`, aimed at new contributors: [#256](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues/256),
  [#257](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues/257) & [#258](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues/258).
  In the end I implemented one myself because it was fun üòÅ
* **post-hacktoberfest**, I also took sometime to write some issue / PR templates,
  so that when newcomers attempt to submit a bug report, a feature request, a PR or just ask a question,
  they are welcome with some nice explanatory text


## A tutorial available in 8 languages!
Among the `fpdf2` [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues) tagged `hacktoberfest`,
one received an outstanding number of contributions:
an issue suggesting to [**translate the one-page tutorial** (#267)](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues/267).

What happened is that, mid-October, a contributor [suggested to translate the tutorial in Portugese](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues/259). I though the idea was great and totally fitted with the context of the hacktoberfest, so I opened issue #267 to encourage other translations.

This was well received as this idea motivated **6 people** to contribute a translation,
making the tutorial available in 8 languages total! [Link to Tutorial](https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/Tutorial.html).


## Results & personal feedback

* **more than 50 issues & PRs** have been created since October 1st, on the `fpdf2` GitHub repo

* `fpdf2` reached **300 stars ‚≠ê** on GitHub! ‚ú® ü•≥ üéâ üéà ü•Ç
* it seems like the **peak downloads per day almost doubled** since September: [Pepy stats](https://pepy.tech/project/fpdf2?versions=2.3.5&versions=2.4.2&versions=2.4.3&versions=2.4.5), [PypiStats](https://pypistats.org/packages/fpdf2)

It was really an amazing experience for me,
and I had this great feeling of being part of some wave of positive human energy!

## Final words

While I had a great time during this Hacktoberfest,
I think that for the next open source / libre software contribution event,
I'll try to pick one where I can be **physically present**.

I simply would have loved chat with the contributors at the end of the event!
To get to know a little who they are and what are their reasons for contributing.

Happy coding to you all!
