I'm happy to introduce you with [genealogic-d3](https://github.com/Lucas-C/genealogic-d3), a Javascript visualization library to nicely display genealogy trees that I've been working on during the past 3 days.

I'm quite satisfied by the result. You'll find a live demo you can play with at https://chezsoi.org/lucas/genealogic-d3/skywalker.html

I used the Skywalker family as an example, but it is really very easy to adapt to [any other family](http://mentalfloss.com/article/27833/11-fictional-family-trees).

On an <!-- NOT SO --> unrelated note : go watch [Predestination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcQacCfi_pw), this time-travelling movie is awesome ! <!-- (SPOILER) but no way genealogic-d3 could display its family tree :) -->
