Yesterday I was crafting some puzzles for my girlfriends,
and I was looking for letter-based ones where I a secret word
would be revealed once solved.

![Solution of a size-12 Wordoku I created displaying the hidden words: AMOUR PASSION](images/2019/05/sudoku-letters-amourpassion-solution.png)

With this same goal, I had already once worked on an open-source JS
[word search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search) generator:
<https://lucas-c.github.io/wordfind/>

_(pour les francophones, vous trouverez quelques autres gÃ©nÃ©rateurs de jeux de lettres / chiffres dans [cet article sur linuxfr.org](https://linuxfr.org/news/generateurs-de-jeux-de-lettres-chiffres-libres))_

This time I started crafting [Masyu](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masyu) puzzles into letter shapes,
but then I realized Sudokus would be a perfect pick, with digits replaced by letters !
Those are sometimes named [Wordokus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku#Alphabetical_Sudoku).

Hence I wrote a Wordoku generator in Python,
where the secret word appears in the diagonal starting from the top-left:
[secret_word_sudokulike_grid_generator.py](https://github.com/Lucas-C/dotfiles_and_notes/blob/master/languages/python/secret_word_sudokulike_grid_generator.py)

```
# ./secret_word_sudokulike_grid_generator.py ensemble

   ..L.|...J               EMLS|BNKJ
   BNK.|...L               BNKJ|EMSL
   ---------               ---------
   ....|....               MLSB|JENK
   J..E|.S.M               JKNE|LSBM
   ---------   solution:   ---------
   S..K|....               SBJK|MLEN
   L..N|KB.S               LEMN|KBJS
   ---------               ---------
   .J.M|.KLB               NJEM|SKLB
   .S.L|..ME               KSBL|NJME
```

Because I wanted to be able to generate grids for any size, even for prime number sizes like 7,
this program can drop the constraint of the boxes for those cases:
the generated grid is a pseudo-sudoku, where the only rules are that columns & rows must contain all letters.

```
# ./secret_word_sudokulike_grid_generator.py --no-boxes-constraint ensemble

   E . M . . L . .               E D M S N L Q B
   . N . M . . S L               Q N D M B E S L
   B E . . . . . N               B E S L Q D M N
   . . . . . . . .   solution:   N S B E L Q D M
   D . L B . N . S               D Q L B M N E S
   . M E . . . N .               L M E D S B N Q
   S B . . E . . D               S B Q N E M L D
   . . . Q D S B .               M L N Q D S B E
```

You can see that the word `ENSEMBLE` appears on the diagonal in the solution.

On the technical side, the script is relatively straightforward.
I only needed a fast sudoku solver.
I used Ali Assaf's excellent one, that he describes in this article:
<https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html>

Using the fact that Sudoku puzzles may be described as an [exact cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Sudoku),
he implemented Donald Knuth Â« Algorithm X Â» with _Dancing Links_ ( how poetic ! )

Kudos to him for writing this. The code is under the GNU GPL license.

At some point I tried to optimize the code using Numpy & Numba,
but I faced many issues with the later lib:
no support for `np.argwhere` / `np.setdiff1d` / `np.isin` / `np.in1d`,
[new bugs](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/4053)...
I started looking at at contributing by implementing those,
but Numba's internal code is quite complex. ðŸ˜ž

In the end I did not bother improving the performances:
even for a large grid like the size-12 one at the top of this article,
the script execution times is between 10s and 10min,
which is totally OK for my needs.

**EDIT [2019/10/05]:** I discovered that this lind of puzzle was sometimes called Â« SudoLettre Â» in French.
