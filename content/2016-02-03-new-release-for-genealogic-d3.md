[A year ago](/lucas/blog/genealogy-tree-visualization-with-d3-js), I built a small JS lib using D3.js to visualize JSON-defined genealogy trees.

At the beginning of the year, I added a new feature using [flex-calendar](https://github.com/Russian60/flex-calendar) and [moment-ferie-fr](https://github.com/DepthFrance/moment-ferie-fr) : a birthday calendar using the same JSON genealogy definition and miniature images.

I added this calendar to the original demo : <https://chezsoi.org/lucas/genealogic-d3>
And here is the github project page : <https://github.com/Lucas-C/genealogic-d3>

If like me you have a large family, it is handy and useful for newcomers to have such a web page, listing everyone's birthdays & photos.
