Essay

(publish VF on linux fr)

Make a diagram out of this:

ETHICAL GOALS:
- ecology
- human rights- sustainable : long-lasting so that public administration can be confident to adopt them
- public domain, the commons, no vendor-lockin
- equity

|
v

MEANS:
- non-ethical uses restrictions : no human rights violation, "exploration, extraction, refinement, processing, or transportation of fossil fuels"...
- transparency : no personal data, no black box algorithms, publishes open data dumps...
- interoperability: so that even if the project dies, its users can easily migrate,
- fair community: code of conduct, avoid maintainers burnout due to the pressure on them,
license that requires companies with a profit large enough to give back...
- software itself has a limited carbon footprint / energy cost...
- accessibility

|
v

ENGAGEMENTS:
- [usage restrictions] through license
- [accessibility] compliance with the RGAA / WCAG
- chart of engagements (ENGAGEMENTS.md?)
- [carbon footprint] provide an estimation of CPU units / RAM usage ?
Label/note indicating how energy-efficient the software is ?

(highlight ideas already in use / not seen on existing FLOSS projects)

Here is an idea :
set up a [liberapay](https://liberapay.com) account,
and decide that the amount collected every year will be split evenly
between all contributors that have submitted & merged at least 10 PRs.
Or register your project at the Software Freedom Conservancy.
