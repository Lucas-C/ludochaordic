The [FOSDEM'20](https://fosdem.org/2020/) _(Free & Open Source Developers’ European Meeting)_ conference is:

> a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate

It took place last week-end at the [Université Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be),
and I had the chance to attend it.

Sincere thanks to my employer, [oui.sncf](https://oui.sncf),
for financing the accommodation & transport!

The following are some frugal notes on the talks I've seen there.

## Saturday 12:00 Civil society needs Free Software hackers - Matthias Kirschner

> More and more traditionally processes in our society now incorporate, and are influenced by software.
> Processes that decide for example: Who will be able to go to which university? Who will be invited for a job interview? How long does someone have to go to jail?

All data is under [Open Data License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_License)

They are extending their initial idea:

- [Open Beauty Facts](https://world.openbeautyfacts.org)
- [Open Pet Food Facts](https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org) (French introduction on [LinuxFr](https://linuxfr.org/news/au-revoir-open-food-facts-et-open-beauty-facts-bienvenue-a-open-pet-food-facts-31-mars-2017))
- [Open Product Facts](https://world.openproductsfacts.org/)

OpenFoodFacts also improves accessibility, _e.g._ allow blind people to know what there is in the food they buy

A truly fascinating talk about programming archaeology, recounting the tale of how the very first Unix build systems!

![Jurassic Park meme: it's a UNIX system, I know this!](images/2020/02/its-a-unix-system-I-know-this.jpg)

PDP-7 sources have been recently recovered,
and at the time, the "userland" was limited to ~25 commands (I only recognized `cat`, `check` & `chmod`),
with `init`, `ln`, `ls`, `mv` & `sh` newly written!

As a side note,  pdp-7 emulator won became IOCCC 2018 winner!

The growth of the number of computers running Unix is quite interesting:

- for Unix 2nd edition (June 1972), there were 10 installations
- for 3nd edition (February 1973) : 16 installations
- for 4th edition (November 1973) : 20 installations
- for 5th edition (June 1974) : above 50 installations
- for 6th edition (May 1975) : over 100 sites

Warner Losh also dwelves into a few interesting questions: What was the first fork of Unix ?
What was the first Unix running under an hypervisor ?

And finally, there is one of the very first Unix fan-arts picture!

## Saturday 15:00 A best practices guide for FLOSS community managers - The Open Source Way v2.0 - Karsten Wade & Shaun McCance
![Purely illustrative event cover image](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_open_source_way/bof_open_source_way-83b63810472da8ae4db2681062d93e88d74b246c13b68b79d7449b47b33ca63c.jpg)

[FOSDEM talk description](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_open_source_way/)

Two speakers from Red Hat presented a project they are starting :
a collaboratively-written, community-driven, guide for FLOSS community managers:

- <http://www.theopensourceway.org> - Some notable sub-pages:

    * [Organizing a community - checklist](https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/Organizing_a_community_-_checklist)
    * [Books you should read](https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/Books_you_should_read)

- GitHub repo [theopensourceway/guidebook](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook),
including some [Guidelines outline](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/master/OUTLINE.adoc)


> a (somewhat opinionated) guidebook for anyone interested in managing open source communities.
> It collects best practices for initiating, nurturing, growing, and maintaining groups of passionate contributors.

Following a question, it was clarified that such guide is only needed at the point where the number of contributors reach a certain point,
where self-organizing does not work / something more structured is needed.

This [birds of feathers (BoF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)) was mainly an exchange of questions
& reflections on this project, hence difficult to summarize.

A provocative idea, but one I found very interesting, was to have a `TESTAMENT.md` file explaining how a project is planning to "retire",
if ever it "fades out", _e.g._ due to a lack of motivated contributors / finance:
would it get archive ? Donated or merged to an org ?


## Saturday 16:00 Journalists are researchers like any others - Anne L'Hôte & Bruno Thomas

The room was full, so I wasn't able to assist to this talk.
Thanks to FOSDEM video recordings, I'll watch it soon!

It made me discover this interesting initiative though:
the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ["Leak to us" page](https://www.icij.org/leak/):

## Saturday 17:30 Creating Sustainable Public Sector Open Source Communities - OSOR team
[FOSDEM talk description](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_public_sector/)

OSOR = [Open Source Observatory](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor)

Description from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Observatory_and_Repository):
> online project launched by the European Commission to support the distribution and re-use of software
> developed by or for public sector administrations across Europe.

This was a collaborative group thinking workshop, and probably the most interesting FOSDEM event of the day for me!

The goal was to have a reflection on guidelines for open-source projects to adopt across Europe,
that would improve their sustainability. They stated that they wanted to initiate

> a discussion on the key elements that contribute to OSS communities’ vibrance, governance and sustainable finance.

The OSOR team constituted of Monika Sowinska, a European Commission project officer,
[Dr Maha Shaikh](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/dr-maha-shaikh), and several consultants from the [Wavestone](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavestone) cabinet.

They told us they were planning to draft, this year, some official guidelines along those lines.
They should get back to us through email, so I'll include more information here when I'll know more.

Note: because OSOR main page is on Joinup, it made me discover this [european "software solutions" catalogue](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solutions) catalogue.

**EDIT [2020/02/24]** : on February the 11th, an email was sent to the participants,
with enclosed a Power-Point presentation (sic) including the slides they showed us during the workshop,
and the "Brainstorming session results".

Those slides can be found online at the bottom of this article on Joinup:
[Workshop on sustainable OSS communities in public sector at FOSDEM20](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/workshop-sustainable-oss-communities-public-sector-fosdem20)

As for myself, I took part in the brainstorming group about "Governance".
I am glad they included pictures of the post-its board in the slides, as they accurately reflect the output of this short session.
However, I have to say that I am surprised on how some of the ideas expressed at the workshop have been transcribed.
I certainly do not recall anyone suggesting anything even close to those "results" from the slides:

> Governance should be enforced because hierarchy does not always happen naturally

> Projects have three core phases that are better facilitated through the enforcement of governance standards:
> 1. Maintenance 2. Deployment 3. Operation

While this "group brainstorming" format was really interesting to generate discussion and exchanges of points of view around those thematics,
I fear that a large part of interpretation has been done on the resulting post-its boards:
I sincerely think that **the "brainstorming session results" from this workshop do not properly reflect the opinions of the participants**.

Finally, I am a bit disappointed that the survey they sent us is only addressed to members of open source community managed by the public sector
[link to the survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/OSORsurvey2020sustainabilitycommunities).
They do not seem interested in consulting members of other open-source communities.

**EDIT [2020/06/02]** : I missed that before but the OSOR has [a newsletter](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/osor-newsletters).

It is also redacting interesting [Intelligence reports](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/open-source-software-country-intelligence)
on the use of open source software per european country.

## Sunday 12:55 Bringing back ethics to open source - Tobie Langel
[FOSDEM talk description](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ethicsbackinoss/)

Link to online slides: <https://speaking.unlockopen.com/8bsoum/bringing-ethics-back-to-open-source>

Really inspiring talk, despite the technical difficulties !

I loved the speaker idea to imagine where we would be if from the start, OSD licenses would have been created with ethics like human rights in mind.

What kind of inspiring uchronia could we imagine there ?

A few random thoughts:

- would it have slowed down OSS adoption ? I'd say no, because most projects would likely not object to pro-human-rights clauses...
It could actually be an attractiveness factor for contributors: we can **assure you** that the code you willingly write under this license
will **never** be used to anti-human-right activities.
- would some kind of failsafe systems be embedded in software, so that a democratically elected body could disable OSS systems used in against human rights ?
- is this subject linked to transparency of OSS usage ? Should OSS usage be registered ? I have strong doubts here...
- there is also the subject of classifying which OSS is "dangerous" to human rights, or definitively not.
- how would you control the application of those licenses terms ?
How would you enforce rules at a worldwide level ? (legally, but also very likely by political "force")

A "strong concept word / image", similar to the term "copyleft", could be useful to express this idea.
Human-rights-enforcing licenses ? Probably not catchy enough...

**EDIT [2020/02/14]**: a similar idea to prevent oil and gas companies to use software under a specific license:
<https://github.com/climate-strike/license>


## Sunday 15:00 File sharing & storage for human rights organizations - Allon Bar & Abigail Garner
[FOSDEM talk description](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/file_sharing_and_storage_for_human_rights_organizations/)

</video>

Also a very interesting talk!

- [Overview of some of the open source tools used by Least Authority](https://leastauthority.com/open-source/)
- [article on their blog summarizing the project](https://leastauthority.com/blog/secure-file-storage-tools-human-rights-defenders/)

One thing I found interesting: they had to write a [_Memorendum of Understanding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding)
to clarify their goals and to reassure their partners about how they do not want to legally bind them.

They mentioned that one of the existing solutions in use by human right organizations was <https://cryptpad.fr>

After the talk, with a friend of mine also present at the FOSDEM, we wondered what what the use of a distributed system in that case?
Supposedly the hosting could be done in "safer" countries, having less to fear from criminal governments, and hence not really at risk?
We also wondered if existing technical solutions like [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) were considered,
and if so why they weren't adopted ?


## Sunday 15:30 Design contributions to OSS: Learnings from the Open Design project at Ushahidi - Eriol Fox
[FOSDEM talk description](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/design_contributions_to_oss/)

An interesting talk, building bridges between the Open Source community and the designers community:
what they can learn from each others, and what the speaker learned from her experience to make both worlds work together.

I hope a video recording will be uploaded.

## Sunday 16:20 European Software Engineering funded research - Luis C. Busquets Pérez
[FOSDEM talk description](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/european_software_funded_research/)

Same here, note much notes taken, also getting a bit tired by the end of the week-end 😉

All those inspiring talks about open source gave me an urgent feeling of "I want to code!",
so I started coding on a new [Pelican plugin](pelican-pingback-and-webmentions.html) instead of paying much attention to this last talk...


## Conclusive notes

The event was awesome!
Everybody felt very friendly, but it was also quite crowded (slightly a bit too much for me).

It felt to me there was a higher proportion of female participants than in other conferences, which is great!

Thanks a lot to the event organizers for putting up a "Dualstack" Wi-Fi hotspot (IpV4 compatible):
I too would like everybody to use IpV6, but with my employer-provided Windows laptop,
I couldn't have accessed Internet at all during this week-end 😁

The number of talks and subjects covered was huge!
[IMHO](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/IMHO), there were just a bit too many "visionary" talks about "the future of the Internet" 🙄

I'll conclude with an interesting read for French-speaking people that are not necessarily into programming & systems,
but are still interested by the ethics & goals of Libre & Open Source software:
