Daniel Linssen, aka [_managore_](https://managore.itch.io), is a fantastic indie game developer. I already mentioned one of his games, HopSlide, in [a previous blog post (FR)](https://chezsoi.org/lucas/blog/2016/11/02/fr-til-cows-tear-us-apart-et-hop-slide/).

Now that it's clear that I am totally unbiased about this incredible game maker, lets talk about his latest games !

### WalkieTalkie

This first one simply amazes me in terms of originality. [WalkieTalkie](https://managore.itch.io/walkie-talkie) concept is just awesome:
you exchange messages in a chat room, **which are all playable levels of a platform game !**

Plus, the artistic direction is lovingly pixelated :

Daniel made it a year ago during the [LudumDare 37](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=3479) game jam, which had for theme "One Room".
Looking [behind the scenes](http://data.takorii.com/wk/get.php?from=0) and given the first chat comment, I'm pretty confident to say that another game developer, [takorii](https://tak.itch.io), gave him a little hand in this project :)

Walkie Talkie reminds me of [Type:Rider](http://store.steampowered.com/app/258890/TypeRider/),
a French game I enjoyed playing very much, as they share a same theme, typography, and platformer gameplay based on letters and text.


### windowframe

[windowframe](https://managore.itch.io/windowframe) has a little bit in common with his previous game [HopSlide](https://chezsoi.org/lucas/blog/2016/11/02/fr-til-cows-tear-us-apart-et-hop-slide/), as it revolves around moving windows **in your operating systems**.

The window resizing mechanics are truly ingenious, but the game puzzles are his real strength: they are well balanced,
extremely smart and most of all very fun !

One thing that stroke most is how the game use window resizing & positioning in some scenes as "camera",
to focus the player sight on one character in one corner of the screen. It's a bit like an animated comics !

It was made for [Ludum Dare 35](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=3479) game jam.
I urge you to test it and brave the terrible 6 vampire bosses !
