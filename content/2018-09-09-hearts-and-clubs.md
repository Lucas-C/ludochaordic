Being currently on a bike tour in Europe for several week, without computer nor smartphone, I don't have the opportunity to post much on this blog.

Still, I'd like to mention a discovery I just made from an Internet caf√© here in Budapest :
the [Hearts and clubs](http://heartsandclubs.com) website.

Curated by By Pierre Corbinais, [OuJeViPo](http://oujevipo.fr) author's, this site collects board games which attempt to address socio-political questions.
