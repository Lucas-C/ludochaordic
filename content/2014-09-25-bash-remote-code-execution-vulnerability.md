Just relaying the information about this "_ShellShock_" vulnerability:

- [RedHat security blog post](//securityblog.redhat.com/2014/09/24/bash-specially-crafted-environment-variables-code-injection-attack/)
- [the full disclosure on seclists.org](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/650)

This seems to affect Apache, `sshd`, DHCP clients and even potentially `git`.

TL;DR here is how to check your Bash version
```
env x='() { echo Never called; }; echo YOUR BASH IS VULNERABLE' bash -c 'echo This is a test'
```

The "YOUR BASH IS VULNERABLE" message should NOT appear in your terminal.

**EDIT**[29/09/2014]: [Tavis Ormandy](//twitter.com/taviso/status/514887394294652929) noticed that the first patch doesn't seem to correct the full vulnerability:
```
env X='() { (a)=>\' sh -c "echo date"; cat echo
```
I the current date is printed, your `bash` version is still vulnerable.
