Hello all.

This is an open request : **does anyone know about equitable non-smart phones or laptops**, ideally long lasting and for the laptops: easily repairable with open-source componants ?

I know about [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com), but I couldn't find anything similar for simpler "feature phones".

By the way, I stumbled upon their cost breakdowns, which are very interesting and well made:

- [Fairphone 1 cost breakdown](https://www.fairphone.com/fr/2013/09/12/costbreakdown/)
- [Fairphone 2 cost breakdown](https://www.fairphone.com/fr/2015/09/09/cost-breakdown-of-the-fairphone-2/)

I'm just going to put down and share my findings here:

- [a thread on the Fairphone forum about feature phones](https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fair-non-smart-phone/655/7) : started in 2014, resurrected in 2016, they point to Nokia being the "most" fair company by rankabrand.org & Greenpeace

- [another thread focuses on laptops](https://forum.fairphone.com/t/which-computer-do-you-recommend/6964) : some very interesting suggestions there

- [why!](https://whyopencomputing.ch) is a Swiss company providing ecological laptops (low consumption, label, repairability) with Ubuntu installed.

- there is an Ecolabel for electronics products : [TCO certified](http://tcocertified.com)

- for repairability, Greenpeace launched a comparator for laptops, tablets & smartphones recently: <https://www.rethink-it.org>

- currently the best solution seems to be refurbished phones and computers. Living in Nantes, I'm going to look into [Alis44](http://www.alis44.org) & [Naga44](http://www.naga44.org) for laptops, and [LeBonCoin](https://www.leboncoin.fr) for dumbphones

**EDIT[2017/11/06]**: a very interesting initiative: [Commown](https://commown.fr)
