Today, I am happy to announce **a new version 2.2.0 of fpdf2** !

<https://github.com/pyfpdf/fpdf2/> [![Pypi latest version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fpdf2.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fpdf2)
Doc: <https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/>

During the last few months, I contributed a few improvements to `fpdf2`,
David Ankin fork of `PyFPDF`,
the user-friendly Python library to generate PDFs:

```python
from fpdf import FPDF
document = FPDF()
document.add_page()
document.set_font('helvetica', size=60)
document.text(x=50, y=50, txt="Hello world!")
document.output("hello_world.pdf")
```

As the original project was not maintained anymore, the two of us teamed up in order to merge several contributors'
_Pull Requests_ submitted to the original project, and improve its documentation and overall code quality.

On my part, I added a [GitHub Actions pipeline](https://github.com/alexanderankin/pyfpdf/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
with as code prettifier (`black`) and a linter (`pylint`),
removed some dead code, added several unit tests, and improved the global performances x100
by using a `byterarray` [for the internal buffer](https://github.com/alexanderankin/pyfpdf/commit/43a2090149a33d028766e88a279d4b54a8fbffff) and also [for image compression](https://github.com/alexanderankin/pyfpdf/commit/fa5620ce7a8d09f748d9dccc345822727c51b4c1).

For more details, you can check the [releases CHANGELOG](https://github.com/alexanderankin/pyfpdf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

There are still many improvements to be done of course.
We'd be happy to here about your feedbacks & suggestions!

One of my main motivations behind this work is a **PDF video game** I'm working on
and I'm eager to present it here soon ðŸ˜‰
