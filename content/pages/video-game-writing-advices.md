[Story Design Tips: The Art of Dialogue by Guy Hasson (2011)](https://guyhasson.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/story-design-tips-5-articles-about-dialogue/):
* Dialogue is made out of **actions**. Whats is it?
    1. Every character has a **purpose** in every scene, even passersby.
    2. In every scene, your character will either: reach her purpose; fail to reach her purpose;       be a step closer to her purpose; or be a step farther from her purpose.
    3. Each scene is made up of little steps the character performs to achieve that purpose, called **actions**
* The rules of dialogue:
    1. **A character must never say her true action in words**:
    > You must find a way for her personality to try and get what she wants without saying it out loud.
    2. **You must never write a line of dialogue that has no action**:
    > you must make up an action for the character that gives him a real reason to provide the information you want delivered
* 4 physical attributes your character needs to have at any given time:
    1. The character’s personality
    2. The character’s mood
    3. The character’s action
    4. How the character would perform that action
* cinematic ways to save a scene when the text is bad:
    1. **Use ‘business’**. Ex: as the characters are speaking, they’re passing a weapon
       from one person to the next, and each of them is fascinated by it and inspects it carefully.
    2. Find **a grain of suspense** regardless of dialogue.
       Ex: Indiana Jones playing with a poisoned date during an exposition scene.
* Dialogues "Don’t":
    1. Don’t Repeat People’s Names
    2. Don’t Answer a Dialogue Line Directly
    3. Don’t Say the Character’s Subtext
    4. Don’t Use Words If You Can Avoid Them
    5. Don’t Characterize Through Length of Speech
    6. Don't Mention the Mechanics of the Dialogue
    7. Don’t Say Anything Twice
    8. Don’t Fill Dead Space with Words
    9. Don’t Show Intensity through Words: this should be conveyed through the character’s physical actions
    10. Don’t Let the Character Tell Us What He Feels: make him act from his emotions

[Creating a Mystery Within a Mystery in 7 Steps by Guy Hasson (2011)](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GuyHasson/20110423/7494/Storytelling_Tips_Creating_a_Mystery_Within_a_Mystery_in_7_Steps.php):
1. Decide on your endgame
2. Make a list of possible avenues of game/story
3-4. Repeat process at lower levels until reaching the desired level of complexity
5. Design the reveals
6. Treat each mystery of the story as if it's the most important one: do not hint that there are bigger things at play until you get to them
7. Bury clues at the outset: clues were there since the very beginning, obvious in retrospect, but before the big reveal

how writers & narrative designers work @ TellTale
> * Writing is responsible for the **characters** and Design is responsible for the **player**,
> but both share responsibility for the **story**.
> * Writing doesn't have a monopoly on the story, Design doesn't have a monopoly on gameplay.
> Making a game is a team effort.

## Puzzle design
_cf._ [shaarli tags gamedesign+AdventureGame](https://chezsoi.org/shaarli/?searchtags=gamedesign+AdventureGame)

[Why Adventure Games Suck And What We Can Do About It - Ron Gilbert - 1989](https://grumpygamer.com/why_adventure_games_suck):
- End objective needs to be clear
- Sub-goals need to be obvious
- Live and learn : no need for "saving"
- Backwards Puzzles
- I forgot to pick it up
- Puzzles should advance the story
- Real time is bad drama
- Incremental reward
- Arbitrary puzzles
- Reward Intent
- Unconnected events
- Give the player options

[Puzzle Design in Adventure Games - Thesis by Rabi Afram - 2013](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:629026/FULLTEXT01.pdf) - **The Ten Principles of Puzzle Design**:
* make the goal of the puzzle easy to understand
* make it easy to get started
* give the player a sense of progress
* give the puzzle a sense of solvability
* increase the difficulty gradually
* have parallelism to let the player rest
* have a pyramid structure to extend the level of interest
* have hints in order to extend the level of interest
* give the answer
* perceptual shifts are double-edged swords

[What Makes a Good Puzzle? -  Game Maker's Toolkit - YouTube - 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjC6fa_YBg&t=156s):
1. [The Mechanics](https://youtu.be/zsjC6fa_YBg?t=59)
> The player should not have to figure "what to do"
> just "how to do it".
2. [The Catch](https://youtu.be/zsjC6fa_YBg?t=156)
> Logical contradiction where 2 things are seemingly
> in conflict with one another.
3. [The Revelation](https://youtu.be/zsjC6fa_YBg?t=267)
> Think outside the box, about how the game works
> This discovery becomes part of your toolbox going on
4. [The Assumption](https://youtu.be/zsjC6fa_YBg?t=480)
> Lure the player that he knows how to beat the puzzle.
Why?
  1. Gives the player a starting point
  2. Help to build a mental model of the puzzle
  3. Ensure the player fails the puzzle the 1st time
  4. Focus the player on the puzzle _Catch_
5. [The Presentation](https://youtu.be/zsjC6fa_YBg?t=662)
> Pretty minimalist, with few moving parts,
> giving the feeling that it shouldn't be hard to beat
> Also: provide clear feedback
6. [The Curve](https://youtu.be/zsjC6fa_YBg?t=887)
> No puzzle is given to the player in isolation
Criteria to judge a puzzle difficulty:
  1. Number of possible solutions
  2. Number of steps required
  3. Number of options a player can choose at each moment
  4. Number of mechanics the player needs to be familiar with

1. Not Knowing What to Do
2. The Pixel Hunt
3. Cock-Blocking aka "you can't do that -- at least not now"
4. No - Not THAT Paper : send the player off in search of something that is represented in the background artwork
5. The Pointless Conversation Option
