Following [last week animated PDF adventure](animated-one-page-dungeon-escape-of-the-torment.html),
I have been reading a series of one page dungeons...
And yesterday I had the opportunity to play the best one in my opinion:
**[The Sky-Blind Spire by Michael Prescott](http://blog.trilemma.com/2016/04/the-sky-blind-spire.html)**.

It has everything I love on one page: a maze to explore, mysteries to unveil, an environment-based conundrum to solve, random encounters, useful items to loot, and lot of thematic consistency between all of that!

I made another clickable PDF for this TTRPG session, that I'm sharing below:

> The goal of this "animated" PDF is to provide the GM with a simple PDF document displaying a map,
> so that they can show it in full screen to the players during the game session,
> and click on rooms exits in order to navigate between locations.

Thanks a lot to Michael Prescott for crafting this wonderful adventure!

In my next blog post, I plan to share a French translation of this one page dungeon,
along with advices on how to use it with [La Lune et Douze Lotus](http://legrumph.org/Terrier/public/chibi/lledl).
