The other day, while working on [fpdf2](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2),
I used [`@dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html),
a nice decorator that came in the standard library with Python 3.7,
to quickly define a `class` that mostly stored data.

Then a question came to my mind: **is the [`__slots__`](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingSlots) memory optimization compatible with `@dataclass`?
Is it even compatible?**.

This very short article is basically an opportunity to answer those questions with some minimal code,
mostly as a reminder to myself:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os, sys
from dataclasses import dataclass

def get_process_rss():  # Similar to: psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
    try:
        with open(f"/proc/{os.getpid()}/statm", encoding="utf8") as statm:
            rss_as_mib = int(statm.readline().split()[1]) * os.sysconf("SC_PAGE_SIZE") / 1024 / 1024
        return f"{rss_as_mib:.1f} MiB"
    except FileNotFoundError:  # /proc files only exist under Linux
        return "<unavailable>"

class A:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

class B:
    __slots__ = ('x', 'y', 'z')
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

@dataclass
class C:
    x: int
    y: int
    z: int

@dataclass
class D:
    __slots__ = ('x', 'y', 'z')
    x: int
    y: int
    z: int

Class = locals()[sys.argv[1].upper()]
l = []
for _ in range(100000):
    l.append(Class(0, 1, 2))
print(get_process_rss())
```

Results on my machine with Python 3.8:
```
$ ./slots_test.py a
26.6 MiB
$ ./slots_test.py b
17.2 MiB
$ ./slots_test.py c
26.7 MiB
$ ./slots_test.py d
17.2 MiB
```
Results on my machine with Python 3.10 in debug mode:
```
./slots_test.py a
28.3 MiB
./slots_test.py b
22.0 MiB
./slots_test.py c
28.3 MiB
./slots_test.py d
22.0 MiB
```

We can conclude that:

* `__slots__` is still an effective memory optimization with recent versions of Python,
  that can save **up to 35% of memory**
* `__slots__` can effectively be combined with `@dataclass`

* [Les slots, une optimisation m√©connue](https://www.invivoo.com/les-slots-une-optimisation-meconnue/), a Frenc blog article pointing that using `__slots__` also makes code faster
* [StackOverflow post on Python `__slots__`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/472000/usage-of-slots)

Well aware of the limitations of `__slots__`, I will definitely adopt more of them in `fpdf2` üòä

Since december, I have been working on tracking memory allocations occuring during the execution of `fpdf2` unit tests suite,
and this is no easy task: [issue #641](https://github.com/PyFPDF/fpdf2/issues/641).
[I stil haven't found what I'm looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3-5YC_oHjE), the main difficulty being the opacity of the Python memory allocator,
and tracking the memory allocated through `malloc` calls by libraries that `fpdf2` depends on,
but it has been very insightful so far! üòÅ
