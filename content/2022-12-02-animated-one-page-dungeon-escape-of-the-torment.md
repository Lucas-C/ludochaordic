Last week, while translating John Harper's micro-TTRPG [World of Dungeons: Turbo Breakers](world-of-dungeons-turbo-breakers.html), I discovered the wonderful world of **one page dungeons**,
starting with Michael Prescott splendid production at [trilemma.com](http://blog.trilemma.com/p/aventures-en-francais.html)
and also the yearly [One Page Dungeon Context](https://www.dungeoncontest.com/).

While crawling through the OPDC 2021 entries, I discovered a great map by [Brett Simison](https://mooselich.com/): _Escape of the Torment_.
With my experience on building "animated" PDFs (on [Undying Dusk](undying-dusk-a-pdf-video-game.html) and another game I'm currently working on), I thought it would be fun to "animate" this great adventure, and here is the result:

> The goal of this "animated" PDF is to provide the GM with a simple PDF document displaying a map,
> so that they can show it in full screen to the players during the game session,
> and click on elements of the map in order for the scene to evolve.

I initially though about building this with HTML, CSS & Javascript as a web page,
but on second though it thought that generating a single PDF could be more handy for GMs,
with the added benefit of not requiring an online connexion. It was also a bit simpler for me not to worry with being adaptive to the browser screen size.

In order to extract the images from the original PDF, I used [LibreOffice Draw](https://libreoffice.org/discover/draw/)
with a custom Python script, included in the ZIP archive.
The archive also includes the `build_animated_EotT.py` program used to generate the animated PDF, using [fpdf2](https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/).

I hope the PDF will be useful to some GMs. I think it would be a good fit for a D & D or [7th Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Sea_(role-playing_game)) adventure. I personnally plan to use it in my [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com) campaign.

The overall approach of animating TTRPG sceneries / battlegrounds as PDF documents could also be applied to other maps!
Of course it does not offer as much expressivity as a Roll20 / Foundry interactive map,
but it can be a handy, simple alternative, and very fun to build for Python coders! üêç
