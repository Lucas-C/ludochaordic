## Video games

For 15 years, I have been collecting some of my favorite video games on [my Shaarli page](https://chezsoi.org/shaarli/)
(it's a self-hosted minimalist link sharing service).
My favorite games all have this tag: [**GreatOnes**](https://chezsoi.org/shaarli/?searchtags=GreatOnes).

I have been playing less video games for the last three years,
but still occasionally find and play some fantastic gems.
